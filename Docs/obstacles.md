-We did not know php well enough to build the quiz on our own, needed the guidance from chris

-group difficulties, elif breaking off from the group

-having to mix html, php and javascript

-in the end, there were a few issues, some files got broken, so we ended up aggregating our code manually. therefore, there are no branches connected to the project.
