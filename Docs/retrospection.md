What went good

Gonzalo:
Thinks he learned quite a bit, Did not have to orient himself on any tutorials or other external resources. 
is happy that he did everything on his own and that it ended up working out

Franco:
Is happy he had two full days to go through the tutorial on codecademy. He would recommend this to others in his situation, as it was the most efficient use of the time. 
He would now be more prepared to do the project, compared to feeling completely unprepared when the project started. 

Is happy that he didn't give up on the project, though he would have appreciated more preparation as the time spent on the project does not seem like the most efficient use of the current week. 
He plans on doing more of the tutorial, as this seems necessary going forward.
